That's just testin SFML Rhytm game. Im still updating it, it's not finished but you can test it anyway.
You can change spawn rate in Game::initVariables();
You can change speed in Notes::updateNote();
You can turn on music by uncommenting initMusic(); in Game(); constructor.
You can change music by writing your music file path in Game::initMusic();
